_Javascript Tutorials for the Developer Portal_

These examples/tutorials will familiarize you with the basics of operating on the steem blockchain.

Each tutorial is located in its own folder, and has a README.md with an outline of the basic concepts
and operations it intends to teach. Some of the tutorials use the production blockchain, others use a [testnet](#Production-Blockchain-vs.-Testnet).

The tutorials build on each other. It's suggested you go through them in-order.

## Production Blockchain vs. Testnet

These tutorials favor use of the production Steem blockchain. However, some produce content that would be spammy. And
spam on a blockchain, like everything else on a blockchain, is forever. Eww.

So for those tutorials we use a [testnet](https://testnet.steem.vc/) setup and maintained by user [@almost-digital](https://steemit.com/@almost-digital).
You can see its current status, and learn how to easily create accounts and connect to it at [https://testnet.steem.vc/](https://testnet.steem.vc/).
And depending on the day, you can even use an outdated version of [condenser](https://github.com/steemit/condenser) to crawl it at [https://condenser.steem.vc/](https://condenser.steem.vc/)
Demo accounts for use on the testnet has already been setup in the `login.json` file. This gets loaded once you run any of the tutorials that uses the testnet, automatically providing the user names and private keys you need for that tutorial.
