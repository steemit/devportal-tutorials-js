# How to Get Post Details

The purpose of this tutorial is to **a)** demonstrate how to get a list of articles from the trending list on the blockchain, and **b)** fetch the contents of the selected post to display its title and body. 

We will also explain the most commonly used fields from the response object as well as parse body of the post.

## Fetching trending posts

As mentioned in our previous tutorial we can fetch various lists of posts with different filters.  Here, we are reusing some parts of that tutorial to list the top 5 trending posts.

```javascript
var query = {
    tag: '', // This tag is used to filter the results by a specific post tag.
    limit: 5, // This allows us to limit the total to 5 items.
    truncate_body: 1 // This will truncate the body of each post to 1 character, which is useful if you want to work with lighter array.
};
```

## Post content

On selection of a particular post from the list, `openPost` function is fired.  This function will call the `get_content` function to fetch content of the post. `get_content` requires author and permlink of the post to fetch its data.

```javascript
client.database.call('get_content',[author,permlink]).then((result)=>{
    const md = new Remarkable({html: true, linkify: true});
    
    const body = md.render(result.body);

    const content = `<div class='pull-right'><button onclick=goback()>Close</button></div><br><h2>${result.title}</h2><br>${body}<br>`;
    
    document.getElementById('postList').style.display='none';
    document.getElementById('postBody').style.display='block';
    document.getElementById("postBody").innerHTML = content;
});
```

Steem allows any text-based format for the body, but apps often follow standard markdown with mix of few html tags. After we have fetched the content, we can use the `remarkable` library to parse the body of the post into a readable format.  The title and body of the post are then displayed with a button at the top right corner to switch back to the post list.

```javascript
	document.getElementById('postList').style.display='block';
    document.getElementById('postBody').style.display='none';
```

The "go back" function simply hides and shows the post list.

## Query Result from post content

The result is returned from the post content as a `JSON` object with the following properties:
